The RIT demonstrates how to interact with Rumblefish’s API to search for and play music from Rumblefish’s music catalog.

For more info on Rumblefish’s API, checkout https://sandbox.rumblefish.com for documentation and examples.

## What Can I Do With the RIT?

Build music licensing into your iOS apps! The RIT is configured to use Rumblefish’s sandbox API environment which contains a limited number of Rumblefish tracks and can not issue commercial licenses or delivery high quality tracks for download.
