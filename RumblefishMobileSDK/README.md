# Rumblefish iOS Toolkit SDK

0. Install the [iOS Universal Framework](https://github.com/kstenerud/iOS-Universal-Framework.git). This package makes it easier for Xcode to build frameworks that behave like packages, for easier incorporation into other applications. Follow the instructions in the repository for installing the templates for the "Real Framework."

1. Open `Mobile SDK.xcodeproj`

2. Build the Framework (Product > Build)

You're done!

To see how to incorporate the SDK into your project, open `../demo/Friendly Music.xcodeproj` and take a look at the `TestVC.m` file.
