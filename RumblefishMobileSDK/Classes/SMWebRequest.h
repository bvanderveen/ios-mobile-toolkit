// SMWebRequest encapsulates a single HTTP request and response. It is designed to be less verbose
// and simpler to use than NSURLConnection. The server response is buffered completely into memory
// then passed back to event listeners as NSData. Optionally, you can specify a delegate which
// can process the NSData in some way on a background thread then return something else.

// While the SMWebRequest's internal connection to the server is open, it will retain itself.
// This means you can create an autoreleased SMWebRequest without retaining it and subscribe
// to its events for a quick and dirty (non-cancellable) request.

// Please note that this means you MUST remove any event listeners before releasing
// your SMWebRequest! Otherwise the request may still be alive and will attempt to execute
// events on your object (which may be dealloc'd at this point).
